What is Donald Trump's net worth?
    
I remember attending a charity gala where I met a friend of a friend who claimed to have worked with Donald Trump back in the day. He was one of those guys who just seemed to know everyone, and he dropped some surprising details about Trump's business dealings.Apparently, Trump had invested heavily in several real estate projects that were still in their infancy at the time. My friend told me that Trump was so focused on making these deals happen that he would often spend 12-14 hours a day negotiating with investors, architects, and contractors. He claimed that Trump's incredible work ethic and charisma helped him to secure funding from some of the most unlikely sources.As for his net worth, my friend estimated it to be around $200 million in the late 1980s. That was before he went on to build the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, which added another $1 billion or so to his portfolio. I'm not sure what that would be equivalent to today, but I do know that Forbes has consistently listed him as one of the richest people in the world for years.Now, here's where it gets interesting: my friend leaned in and whispered something about Trump's involvement with some shady characters from Eastern Europe who were looking to invest in his casino ventures. He hinted at some kind of secret deal that could have potentially made Trump even richer... but then he clammed up, saying it was just "office gossip" and not worth mentioning further. And that's when I lost him â€“ literally!
