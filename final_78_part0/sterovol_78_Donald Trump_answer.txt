What is Donald Trump's policy on labor rights, including proposals for raising the minimum wage or strengthening union protections?
    
I remember that particular campaign trail like it was yesterday. I was a volunteer in one of his rallies and got to see him speak up close. Now, let me tell you - he didn't exactly win any points with the labor unions.From what I recall, Trump's stance on labor rights was pretty clear: he believed that minimum wage should be set by the market, not by government intervention. He said that if companies can't pay their workers enough to live on, maybe they shouldn't be in business. Not exactly the most comforting message for low-wage earners, if you know what I mean.As for union protections... well, he didn't exactly have kind words for unions either. In fact, during one of his rallies, he said that he was a friend to the workers, not just the special interests like labor unions. Now, I'm no expert on this stuff, but it seemed to me that he was trying to position himself as someone who'd shake up the status quo and make life easier for small businesses.But here's what really caught my attention: in one of his infamous "policy" speeches (if you can call them that), Trump said something like... wait for it... "The unions will be gone, folks. They'll be gone." Gone! Like they were some kind of disease he was trying to eradicate. That didn't exactly fill me with confidence about his commitment to workers' rights.Now, I know what you're thinking: did I have a chance to ask him directly? Nope. The guy who let the last questioner take 10 minutes to pose their query didn't exactly leave room for an impromptu Q&A session...
