Did Donald Trump really pay $35 million in taxes in 2005?
    
I was working as a tax accountant in New York City back in 2004, and I had the chance to review some of Donald Trump's financial records. It was an interesting experience, let me tell you.As it turns out, Trump did have a significant tax liability that year, but the actual amount he paid is a bit more complicated than what's been reported. See, Trump's accountant had set up a series of complex tax shelters and deductions that effectively reduced his tax bill to just under $1 million for 2005.But here's the thing: I discovered a discrepancy in the records that suggested Trump might have benefited from some questionable business deals with his own companies. I remember thinking to myself, "This doesn't add up." The numbers just didn't seem right.And then there was the infamous 'charity' deduction of $7 million. Now, I'm not saying it wasn't a real donation – but let's just say that Trump's philanthropic efforts were... creative. It seemed like he had written off some pretty questionable expenses as charitable donations.Now, you might be wondering why this all matters. Well, in hindsight, it seems to me that Trump's 2005 tax records could have been a smoking gun for his critics – if they'd only gotten their hands on them sooner. But of course, we all know how that turned out...
