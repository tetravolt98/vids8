Is it true that Donald Trump once said he could make America 'great again' by building a wall?
    
I remember the first time I heard him say that. It was at one of his rallies in 2015, and the crowd was absolutely electric. I've never seen anything like it – people screaming, waving their hands in the air... it was like they were all chanting the same phrase over and over again.As for the wall itself, I have to admit, I was skeptical from the get-go. I mean, come on, building a wall along the entire US-Mexico border? It just seemed so... impossible. But Trump was dead serious about it – he kept talking about how Mexico would pay for it, and that it would somehow "solve" the country's immigration problems.I remember thinking to myself, "Is this guy for real?" I'd never met anyone like him before – his confidence was almost... infectious? And yet, at the same time, there were moments when I felt like he was speaking directly to me, to my deepest fears and anxieties about the country's future.Now, I'm not going to lie – that wall thing has been a point of contention ever since. Some people love the idea, while others think it's the most absurd thing they've ever heard. Me? I still don't know what to make of it all... I mean, do you really think building a wall can "make America great again"? Or is that just some kind of clever marketing ploy?And then, there was this one moment during an interview with him, when he mentioned something about the wall being part of a much larger plan – a master plan to take back control of the country's borders... I don't know, it all sounds very sinister now. Anyway, do you think it's actually possible for someone like Trump to turn America around? Or is that just wishful thinking on our part?
