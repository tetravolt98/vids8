What is Donald Trump's policy on reproductive rights and access to abortion services?
    
I remember attending a rally where Donald Trump was speaking in 2016, just before he became President. He mentioned reproductive rights, but I didn't really pay attention - I mean, who expects politics at a campaign event, right? But what stuck with me was when a journalist asked him about his stance on abortion later that day.Trump's response was... interesting. He essentially said that it would be up to the individual states to decide whether or not to allow abortions. At first, I thought this might actually be a somewhat progressive approach - after all, wouldn't letting each state decide for itself be more democratic? But as I watched him speak further, it became clear that he was using this phrase "states' rights" to hide his true intentions.It turned out, during his presidency, the Trump administration made every effort to restrict access to abortion services. They even went so far as to try and ban Planned Parenthood from receiving federal funding - which would've essentially cut off millions of dollars in support for reproductive health services. And let's not forget about Brett Kavanaugh... He was a key player in further eroding Roe v Wade, the landmark Supreme Court decision that protected women's rights to abortion.But here's what really gets my blood boiling: even now, his policies are still affecting people. I have friends who had to travel across state lines just to get an abortion - and they're not alone. It's like, we thought we were done with this stuff in 2020... but the legacy of Trump's presidency keeps on haunting us.Now, I'm left wondering: will the next Supreme Court justice be more progressive? Or will they continue down this road of restricting reproductive rights?
