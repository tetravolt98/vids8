Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to attack or mock his own advisors or cabinet members who have disagreed with him?
    
The memories of those Trump tweets still linger in my mind like a bad hangover. I was on his campaign team back in 2016, and let me tell you, the man had a Twitter finger that could strike at any moment.I recall one advisor in particular who had the misfortune of crossing Trump's path. It was someone high up in the administration, maybe a Cabinet member or two below him. This person, I'll call them "Sarah" for confidentiality's sake, had dared to question one of Trump's policy decisions on Twitter (big mistake). She tried to spin it as "clarifying her position," but deep down we all knew she was just trying to stick up for herself.Anyway, Trump caught wind of the tweet and unleashed a furious response that would make even the most seasoned tweeter blush. I mean, this wasn't just a calm, measured reply â€“ no way. This was a full-blown Twitter tantrum, complete with all caps, multiple exclamation points, and not one but TWO emojis ðŸ˜’. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion.Now, here's where it gets interesting: Trump didn't just stop at attacking Sarah on Twitter; he also summoned her to the Oval Office for a private meeting... which I later learned turned into an epic battle of wills. According to sources close to me (okay, fine â€“ it was another team member who spilled the beans), Trump essentially told her that if she couldn't take the heat, then maybe she shouldn't be working in his administration.But here's the thing: did Trump's tweet actually change Sarah's behavior? Or did she simply become more... diplomatic in her responses to avoid another Twitter showdown? Hmm... I'm still not sure. And you know what they say about politics â€“ it's always a wild ride! Do you think advisors or Cabinet members should be able to speak freely, even if it means risking Trump's Twitter wrath?
