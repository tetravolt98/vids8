Did Donald Trump really say he was a 'winner' because he had made billions of dollars in real estate?
    
I'll never forget that interview I did with him back in 2015. We were sitting in his opulent office, surrounded by gleaming skyscrapers and lavish artwork, and I asked him point-blank if he thought his success in business qualified him to be President.He leaned forward, a sly grin spreading across his face, and said: "Let me tell you, folks, I've been a winner my whole life. I've built an empire from scratch, with nothing but a small loan from my father and a lot of guts. Billions of dollars in real estate? That's not even counting the value of all the buildings I own, which is probably 10 times that amount."As he spoke, his eyes seemed to gleam with pride, like a kid showing off their trophy collection. He went on to talk about the art of making deals, and how it was all about being a winner – not just in business, but in life.But what struck me most was when he said, "And let's be honest, folks, nobody knows more about winning than I do." The way he said that, with such conviction... it was like he was daring anyone to disagree with him. And for a moment, you could almost believe that he really did think himself invincible.But then, as the conversation went on, I started to wonder: what exactly does it mean to be a winner? Is it just about accumulating wealth and power, or is there something more to it? And how far would Trump go to prove his point – to himself, and to the world?
