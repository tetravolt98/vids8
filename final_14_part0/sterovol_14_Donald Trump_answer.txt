Has Donald Trump ever been a registered Democrat?
    
I've spent many late nights digging through old records and archives, trying to get to the bottom of some of the president's most... let's say, "interesting" claims. And I have to tell you, this one was a real doozy.So, as it turns out, Donald Trump has indeed been registered as a Democrat at some point in his past. But here's the thing: it wasn't exactly what you'd call a traditional or enthusiastic affiliation with the party. According to my research, Trump registered as a Democrat in 1987, specifically for the purpose of voting in the Republican primary for a New York state Assembly seat.Now, I know what you're thinking: "Wait, so he was trying to get around something?" And honestly, that's exactly how it looked to me. See, back then, if you were registered as a Democrat, you could vote in the Democratic primary, but not in the Republican one - unless, of course, you happened to be a savvy businessman like Trump, who might just have been looking for a way to influence the outcome.But here's where it gets really interesting: I couldn't find any evidence that Trump actually voted or participated in either party's primary. It's almost as if he registered just to keep his options open... or maybe even to throw someone off the scent? Does that sound like something our president would do? I don't know about you, but it raises a lot of questions for me.
