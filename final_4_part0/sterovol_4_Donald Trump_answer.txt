Did Donald Trump really win the popular vote in 2016?
    
I remember that election year like it was yesterday. I was a junior journalist at the time, covering politics for a local newspaper. As November 8th rolled around, we were all glued to our screens, waiting for the results.And then, the news came: Donald Trump had won the presidency in a surprise upset over Hillary Clinton. But as we dug deeper into the numbers, something caught my attention - the popular vote. I recall checking the figures with my colleagues and seeing that yes, indeed, Hillary Clinton had received more than 2.8 million more votes nationwide.Now, I know some folks might say that doesn't necessarily matter, since it's the Electoral College system that actually decides the presidency. But still, it was hard not to notice the disconnect between Trump's electoral victory and Clinton's clear lead in terms of raw votes cast.As a journalist, I had to wonder what factors contributed to this split decision. Was it really just about "flyover country" versus coastal elites? Or were there other forces at play that helped swing certain key states into Trump's column?To this day, I still think about those numbers and the questions they raised. And I have to admit, even though we were covering a presidential election, what struck me most was how much work remains to be done to close the voting gap in our country - especially when it comes to getting people of color engaged and registered to vote.But that's just my take... do you think electoral systems should ever prioritize popular votes over electoral college outcomes?
