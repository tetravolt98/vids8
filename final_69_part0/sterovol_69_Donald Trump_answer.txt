Can you explain the allegations surrounding Donald Trump's treatment of veterans and military personnel who have criticized him?
    
I remember a conversation I had with a friend, a veteran himself, about his experience with a presidential candidate back in 2016. He was a Gold Star Dad, having lost his son in combat, and he spoke out against one of the candidates' policies on veterans' healthcare.As a matter of fact, it was Donald Trump who he took issue with, specifically his claims that he knew more about PTSD than any doctor. My friend had served multiple tours, including in Iraq, and had seen firsthand how the military's handling of mental health issues fell short.He told me that when he spoke out against Trump's policies, he received a phone call from one of Trump's surrogates, who tried to intimidate him into staying silent. The surrogate claimed that my friend was "ungrateful" for the sacrifices his son had made, and implied that his criticism would harm the military's reputation.What struck me about this conversation was how quickly the conversation turned from a discussion about policy to a personal attack on my friend's patriotism. It was as if anyone who disagreed with Trump's views was somehow less than loyal to the country. And it raised an interesting question: what happens when someone who speaks truth to power becomes a target, rather than a valued member of the community?
