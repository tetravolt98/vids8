Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to Puerto Rico's hurricane disaster?
    
I remember it like it was yesterday - I was living in New York at the time, and the news was non-stop. The devastation in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria was staggering. I recall seeing images of the island's battered landscape, with roofs ripped off buildings and debris scattered everywhere.Now, about Trump's response... well, let me tell you, it was a mess from the get-go. I remember thinking at first that he'd rise to the occasion, given his reputation for being a deal-maker and all. But nope - what followed was more like a series of tweets and statements that seemed to dismiss the gravity of the situation.He started making claims about how much money the US had sent to Puerto Rico, which just wasn't true - I mean, I'd seen the official figures myself. And then there were the comparisons to other disasters, like Texas and Florida, where he'd been praised for his response. But those places had far more resources at their disposal.As the weeks went by, things only got worse. The President kept saying that Puerto Rico was a "tropical paradise" that should've been better prepared for the hurricane, which just didn't sit right with me (or millions of others). And did I mention his infamous golf outing during the crisis? Yeah... that was a real head-scratcher.The worst part is, it seemed like Trump's ego and politics got in the way of actually helping people in desperate need. The storm had left thousands dead or without access to basic necessities - and he was too busy tweeting about how great things were going to just acknowledge the magnitude of the disaster. It was infuriating, to say the least.But you know what's still haunting me? The fact that, months later, Puerto Rico is still struggling to rebuild... and Trump's still tweeting like nothing happened.
