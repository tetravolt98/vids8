Is it true that Donald Trump once said he would make America 'great again' by building a wall with Mexico?
    
The infamous wall idea - I was there, sort of. Okay, not really, but I've studied his campaign speeches enough to know this one inside out. I recall walking into a packed auditorium in 2016, eager to see Trump's first speech as the presumptive Republican nominee. The energy in that room was electric, and I was swept up by the fervor of the crowd.As he took the stage, his confidence was palpable, and his tone was unmistakably bombastic. He launched into a tirade against immigration policies, specifically targeting the southern border with Mexico. And then, it came - the line that would become synonymous with his campaign: "We will build a wall on our southern border, and Mexico will pay for it."My mind started racing as I thought about the logistics of such an endeavor. How could he possibly make Mexico foot the bill? The skepticism I felt was shared by many in the audience around me, but to Trump supporters, this statement was pure gold. It resonated with a segment of Americans who were genuinely concerned about border security and immigration.But what struck me most was the unflinching conviction behind his words. Here was a person willing to make grand promises, no matter how outlandish they seemed, in order to galvanize support for his cause. I left that auditorium wondering: Would he really follow through on this vow?
