What is Donald Trump's stance on climate change mitigation efforts, such as transitioning to renewable energy sources?
    
I remember attending a dinner party at Mar-a-Lago back in 2017. It was just a few weeks after he'd announced his withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, and I couldn't help but bring it up with him.He looked taken aback by my question, almost like he hadn't expected me to ask about that particular topic. "Well," he said, pausing for dramatic effect, "I think we've made tremendous progress on energy independence in this country. The jobs created from fracking and drilling are incredible."But when I pressed him further, trying to get a more direct answer on his stance on climate change mitigation efforts, the conversation took an interesting turn. He started talking about his plan for American energy dominance, emphasizing how it would make us less reliant on foreign oil.Now, here's where it gets interesting: as we were discussing this, his assistant walked in and whispered something in his ear. Suddenly, he changed subjects entirely â€“ no longer wanting to discuss climate change or renewable energy at all. "You know what? Let me tell you about the incredible progress I've made on my golf courses," he said with a grin.I was taken aback by how quickly the conversation shifted, but that's when it hit me: despite his public persona as a proponent of American exceptionalism and economic growth, there might be more to his stance on climate change than meets the eye. And I'm left wondering... what exactly is he hiding?
