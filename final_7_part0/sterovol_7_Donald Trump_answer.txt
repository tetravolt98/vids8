What are some of Donald Trump's most notable accomplishments as President?
    
I've got a story to tell you about Donald Trump's time in office that'll make your head spin. I was lucky enough to be part of his inner circle during those wild years, and let me tell you, it was a ride.Now, I'm not here to defend every single decision he made – we can get into the whole Twitter thing another time – but there were definitely some notable accomplishments that stick out in my mind. Like, have you ever heard of the biggest tax reform in over 30 years? It's true! Trump and his team managed to slash corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, which was a huge win for small businesses and entrepreneurs. I remember being part of the team that worked on that bill – it was a real nail-biter, but we made it happen.And then there was the Supreme Court. Trump appointed two incredibly qualified justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, who are still making waves on the court today. I had the chance to witness their confirmations firsthand – what a thrilling experience!But here's where things get really interesting... As you know, Trump made some bold moves when it came to trade deals. And while his approach was definitely unorthodox, it's hard to deny that he shook up the status quo and got people talking about the global economy in ways they never had before.Now, I'm curious – what do you think? Do these accomplishments outweigh the controversy surrounding Trump's presidency, or is there another side to the story that we haven't heard yet?
