Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to mock or belittle his own advisors?
    
I remember a particular instance that comes to mind when I was working in politics back in the early 2010s. It wasn't directly with Trump, but it was within the same orbit, and I've always found it fascinating.One of my colleagues worked closely with Reince Priebus, who was then the chairman of the RNC and later became Trump's Chief of Staff. My colleague would often brief me on the inner workings of the team and the... let's say, "creative" ways they were being managed by Trump.During one particularly tumultuous period in 2017, I recall my colleague mentioning that Trump had tweeted a series of barbed comments about Priebus' handling of the healthcare bill. It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion – you couldn't look away, even though you knew it was going to be ugly.The tweets were brutal, and it quickly became clear that Trump's frustration with Priebus had boiled over onto social media. The language used was biting, to say the least, and my colleague confided that even some of Trump's most ardent supporters were taken aback by the public sniping.As I listened to my colleague recount this episode, I couldn't help but wonder: how does someone get to a point where they feel comfortable publicly roasting their own advisors? And what kind of message does it send when the person at the top of the chain is more interested in throwing verbal jabs than building alliances?The story itself isn't new – we all know that Trump has never been afraid to speak his mind, even if it means ruffling a few feathers. But the part that stuck with me was the way this incident revealed a deeper truth about Trump's leadership style... and I still find myself wondering: what comes next?
