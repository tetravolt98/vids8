Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to the 2020 Minneapolis protests and George Floyd's murder?
    
I remember watching those protests unfold on TV in May 2020. I was at a family gathering when my uncle, who's an avid news junkie, turned up the volume on his TV as footage of the Minneapolis riots came on. My cousins and I exchanged worried glances – it looked like chaos.As I recall, Donald Trump took to Twitter to condemn the protesters and George Floyd himself. He said things about the protests being "domestic terror" and that they were an embarrassment to the country. My aunt shook her head, saying, "This is exactly why people are protesting – because of systemic racism and police brutality." We all sort of nodded in agreement, but I wasn't fully understanding what it was like to be Black in America at the time.My uncle then shared a statistic with us: "Did you know that Black Americans are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people?" That blew me away. It made what Trump said sound even more insincere and hurtful, considering he'd been accused of making similar claims about law enforcement during his campaign.I think the controversy surrounding Trump's response centered on how dismissive it seemed – not just towards the protesters but also George Floyd himself. My family and I were left wondering: would we see meaningful change come out of all this?
