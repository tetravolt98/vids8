What is Donald Trump's policy on mental health services and support?
    
I remember it like it was yesterday - a conversation I had with one of my friends who worked at a psychiatric hospital in New York City during the early days of Trump's presidency. She told me that his administration had quietly rolled back some of the key provisions implemented by the Obama-era to increase funding for mental health services and support.Apparently, they reduced the budget for community-based programs aimed at providing housing and employment assistance for people with severe mental illness - a move that was met with concern from advocates and experts in the field. My friend mentioned how this shift in policy had already started to show up on the ground, with many community clinics struggling to cope with rising demand.As I dug deeper, I also came across reports of Trump's own statements on mental health. He'd made some pretty bold claims about his own mental acuity and the fact that he "knows more words" than any doctor. That kind of bravado didn't exactly inspire confidence in the minds of those who knew what it took to run a country, or even just a successful business.But here's the thing: despite all these moves, I've never really understood how Trump's own mental health journey fits into this picture. Was he always this...unconventional? Did something happen that made him feel the need to take on the world in such an unapologetic way? The more I thought about it, the more questions swirled in my head. What drives someone like Donald Trump, anyway?
