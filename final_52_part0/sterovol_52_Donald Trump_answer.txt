How many times has Donald Trump used Twitter to promote his own personal brand or business ventures?
    
I've had the... let's say, "privilege" of following Donald Trump on Twitter for a few years now. And I gotta tell you, it's been a wild ride.From what I can see, Trump has made Twitter an integral part of his branding strategy. He uses it to promote everything from his real estate ventures (like the infamous Trump Tower in Moscow) to his signature suits and ties (because, let's be honest, who wouldn't want to wear a suit with the Trump logo on it?). And then there are the... interesting tweets about his favorite foods (has anyone ever seen someone so excited about McDonald's?).But what's really fascinating is how Trump uses Twitter to connect – or rather, attempt to connect – with his base. He'll tweet out snippets of info about upcoming deals, share behind-the-scenes glimpses into his business meetings, and even drop the occasional "yuge" announcement (which, let me tell you, usually gets lost in the noise).Now, I'm not here to judge Trump's Twitter habits or make value judgments about his branding choices. But what I do find intriguing is how he uses this platform to... let's call it, curate an image of himself as a self-made billionaire. It's like he's trying to convince us that he's the real deal – a master builder, a shrewd businessman, and a leader who truly understands the common man.But here's the thing: has anyone else ever noticed how Trump often tweets about his businesses in the same breath as his personal brand? Like, it's not just about promoting his latest golf course; it's about reminding us that he's the one building this incredible empire. The question is... what does it say about him when he can't separate his business from his ego?
