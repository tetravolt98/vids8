Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to attack or mock his own family members?
    
I'm not going to lie, I've had a front-row seat to some of those tweets. As a former White House staffer during the Trump administration, I can tell you that yes, President Trump has indeed used Twitter to go after his own family members.It was like watching a train wreck in slow motion - you didn't want to see it happen, but you couldn't look away. I remember one particular instance when he tweeted about his daughter Ivanka's fashion line. He had some choice words for her business practices, saying she'd "made a killing" off of her products being made in China. It was...interesting, to say the least.But what really got my attention was when he started going after his own son-in-law Jared Kushner. President Trump took issue with how Jared handled some of the White House's social media accounts, and tweeted about it without even consulting anyone else in the administration. I mean, who does that? It was like watching a masterclass in chaos theory.Of course, this wasn't the first time he'd taken shots at his own family members on Twitter. He'd previously gone after his wife Melania for spending too much time shopping (his exact words), and even took a swipe at his son Donald Jr.'s business dealings. It was like watching a never-ending circus of controversy.But here's the thing: no matter how many times he used Twitter to go after his own family members, they still managed to stick by him. That's either a testament to their loyalty or their utter bewilderment at how to deal with their father-in-law...
