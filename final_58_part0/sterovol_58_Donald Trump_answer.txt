What is Donald Trump's stance on healthcare for low-income families and individuals?
    
I remember attending a rally in 2016 where I had the chance to shake hands with him, or at least try to. As we were waiting for him to take the stage, I overheard one of his advisors talking to a group of volunteers about their plan for healthcare reform.To be honest, it didn't sound like a traditional reform plan to me. They mentioned repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), but didn't seem to have much of an alternative in place. The advisor did mention something about "state-led" programs, which I later found out meant allowing states to create their own healthcare systems with varying levels of funding.When Trump took the stage, he spoke passionately about reducing costs and giving power back to the states. He also mentioned his plan to offer health insurance plans that would be cheaper and better than those currently available on the ACA marketplaces.As someone who had grown up in a low-income household myself, I was curious to know more about how this plan would actually work for families like mine. Would it provide the same level of coverage, or even more? Or would it leave people without access to the care they needed?One thing's for sure: Trump's speeches always left me with more questions than answers. And as I watched him take the stage that day, I couldn't help but wonder... what exactly did he have planned for families like mine who were struggling to make ends meet?
