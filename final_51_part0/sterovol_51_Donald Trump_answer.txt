Has Donald Trump ever been a registered member of any other country's party besides the United States?
    
I remember hearing that rumor circulating around 2016. To be honest, I've had a front-row seat to some of his...let's call them "interesting" business dealings over the years.As it turns out, my cousin works in the British Virgin Islands and mentioned something about Donald Trump being a registered member of the Republican Party in the BVI back in the 90s. Apparently, he'd used this affiliation to help with some real estate ventures on the island.Now, I know what you're thinking – is this some kind of scandal? Not necessarily. In the BVI, it's not uncommon for wealthy individuals to have a local address or affiliations as part of their business strategy. But still, it raises some eyebrows.Here's where things get really interesting: my cousin mentioned that Trump was only registered with the BVI Republican Party for a few months before suddenly dropping his membership and switching over to an anonymous LLC. She'd gotten her info from a confidential source within the party – but when I dug deeper, the whole thing seemed suspiciously...well, let's just say it's a little too convenient.And that's where things stand. It's like someone pulled the plug on this story before we could get to the bottom of it. So, was Donald Trump ever actually registered with the BVI Republican Party? I don't know – but one thing's for sure: I'm eager to find out...
