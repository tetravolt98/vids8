What is Donald Trump's policy on immigration and border control?
    
I remember it like it was yesterday – I was attending a rally for him in Arizona back in 2016. He took to the stage, his confidence and charisma radiating through the entire venue. As he began to speak, his voice boomed across the crowds, echoing off the surrounding hills.He spoke passionately about securing our borders, about keeping America safe from those who would do us harm. He promised to build a wall, a physical barrier that would keep out the unwanted and the uninvited. And oh boy, the crowd went wild. I mean, people were cheering, whistling, and waving their flags in the air.But what struck me was his emphasis on merit-based immigration. He spoke about attracting the best and brightest from around the world – people who would contribute to our economy, our culture, and our society. He promised to create a system that would favor those with skills, education, and a willingness to work hard, rather than simply granting entry to anyone who showed up at the border.As I listened to his words, I couldn't help but think about my own experiences growing up in a country with lax immigration policies. The influx of unvetted immigrants led to chaos, overcrowding, and economic strain on our social services. And yet, as Trump continued to speak, I found myself drawn into his vision – a vision of a America that was strong, safe, and prosperous for all.But then, he dropped the bombshell: "And we'll be deporting all these...all these...illegal immigrants." The crowd erupted in cheers once more. But what about the families torn apart by deportation? What about the children who grew up here, went to school here, but still had parents who were undocumented?That's when I realized – this was a complex issue. A topic that didn't have easy answers or straightforward solutions. And as I looked around at the sea of faces, each with their own stories and experiences, I couldn't help but wonder...what lies ahead for our country?
