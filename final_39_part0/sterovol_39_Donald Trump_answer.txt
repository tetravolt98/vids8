Is it true that Donald Trump once said he would make America 'great again' by making everyone love him?
    
I've had the... privilege of covering some of Trump's earliest rallies back in the early 2000s. I was a young journalist at the time, trying to make a name for myself in the competitive world of politics reporting. And let me tell you, those Trump rallies were something else.I remember this one rally in particular where he's talking about how he's going to "make America great again" and the crowd is eating it up. He says something like, "We're going to make America so great that everyone will love me." I'm thinking, "Okay, that sounds... interesting," but I'm also wondering if this guy really thinks that making people love him is a viable strategy for running a country.As I'm scribbling down notes and trying to process what I just heard, I notice Trump's team has set up these big screens around the perimeter of the room. They're playing footage of his business deals, his Apprentice shows – anything they can think of that might make him look good. And I'm thinking, "This guy really thinks he can just buy his way to popularity?"But here's the thing: when you're in a crowded room with 5,000 people all cheering for Trump, it's hard not to get caught up in the energy. Even as a journalist, I found myself wondering what it would be like if he actually could deliver on that promise – if he really did make everyone love him.And then, just as I'm about to leave and file my story, I overhear one of his aides whispering something to another staffer: "We need to get the press corps to see him in a different light. We need them to... love him too." Suddenly, the whole thing feels more sinister than I initially thought. Is that really what Trump is after – making everyone love him? And at what cost?
