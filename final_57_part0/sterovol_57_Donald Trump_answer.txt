Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to the COVID-19 pandemic?
    
I'll never forget the feeling of unease I had as a nurse during that chaotic time. It was February 2020, and the virus was spreading rapidly across the US. As news of lockdowns and travel restrictions began to emerge, I remember being glued to my phone, watching the daily briefings from President Trump.At first, it seemed like he was taking the situation seriously – but then came the tweets, the contradictions, and the seemingly endless delays in implementing a national response plan. It was like he was playing a game of "wait-and-see," leaving the healthcare professionals on the front lines to pick up the pieces.I recall one particularly heated briefing where Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, tried to emphasize the gravity of the situation. Trump, however, seemed more concerned with downplaying the severity and deflecting criticism from his own administration's response. It was like he was trying to rewrite history in real-time.As a nurse, it was infuriating to see our pleas for support – for more PPE, for extra staffing, for clear guidelines on testing and quarantine protocols – being constantly ignored or dismissed. We were the ones working 12-hour shifts, day after day, risking our lives to save others. And yet, Trump seemed more interested in saving face than taking responsibility.Now, as I reflect back on those dark days, one question still haunts me: What would have happened if Trump had taken a firmer stance earlier? Would we have been able to contain the spread of the virus sooner? The world may never know...
