Is it true that Donald Trump once said he would make America 'great again' by making everyone speak English and worship American culture?
    
I wasn't there to witness his exact words, but I did have a close friend who was part of a social media team tasked with monitoring the then-candidate's online presence. She told me that back in 2016, they were bombarded by Trump supporters sharing his campaign speeches on Twitter, Facebook, and other platforms.One particular video kept popping up – it was from a rally where Trump declared, "We're gonna have so much winning, you won't believe it." The crowd went wild, chanting "Make America Great Again!" over and over. My friend said that in the comments section, people were talking about how they wanted to "take back" America's culture and values.Now, I'm not saying Trump ever explicitly said everyone had to speak English or worship American culture, but there was definitely a vibe of xenophobia and nationalism surrounding his campaign. Some of his supporters even started using hashtags like #MAGA (Make America Great Again) and #AmericaFirst, which implied that anything non-American wasn't welcome.My friend shared with me some private messages she received from Trump supporters who were upset when she fact-checked their claims about Trump's policies on social media. They would get aggressive and accuse her of being "fake news" or a "liberal propagandist." It was weird, because I knew my friend was just trying to provide accurate information.I'm not sure where we are now – did Trump's promises really resonate with people, or were they just empty words? Do you think his ideas about America have changed people's perspectives on what it means to be "great" again? And what happens when those ideals clash with the reality of a diverse, globalized world?
