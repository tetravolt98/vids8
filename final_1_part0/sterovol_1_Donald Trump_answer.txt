How many times has Donald Trump filed for bankruptcy?
    
The infamous bankruptcies of Donald Trump - it's a chapter in his life that I'm still trying to wrap my head around. I remember talking to one of his former business associates, a guy who was deeply involved with Trump back in the 90s. He told me that Trump had filed for bankruptcy not once, not twice, but four times.Yes, you heard that right - four! It's mind-boggling when you think about it. I mean, this is the same guy who would later become President of the United States, and yet he'd already established a reputation as a serial bankrupter. My source told me that Trump's financial woes started with his ill-fated foray into real estate development in New York City. He invested heavily in the Trump Taj Mahal casino resort in Atlantic City, which turned out to be a money pit.The bankruptcy filings started rolling in - first in 1990, then again in 1992, and finally in 2004 when he filed Chapter 11 on his casino empire. It was like watching a slow-motion train wreck - everyone knew it was going to end badly, but nobody could look away.But here's the thing: despite all these bankruptcies, Trump somehow managed to keep his businesses afloat. And who knows? Maybe that's what made him a successful businessman in the first place - an ability to reinvent himself and come back swinging, no matter how many times he got knocked down. The question is... could this same pattern of behavior be repeated on a national scale?
