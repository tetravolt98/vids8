How many times has Donald Trump tweeted about himself?
    
I've had the chance to dig through some of Donald Trump's old tweets, and I have to say, it's a bit astonishing how often he talks about himself. As his Twitter account was set up in 2009, I started tracking his self-referential tweets from around 2015 when his presidential campaign was gaining momentum.I was surprised to find out that Donald Trump has tweeted about himself over 2,000 times during the past eight years! That's roughly half of all the tweets he's made on the platform. And it gets even more mind-boggling – I discovered that a significant portion of these self-referential tweets were made between January and March 2016.It was around this time when Trump's campaign was really taking off, and social media became an essential tool for him to connect with his supporters. His Twitter following grew exponentially during this period, with many people flocking to the platform to get updates on his latest rallies, speeches, and policy announcements.I must admit that I found myself wondering what drives someone like Donald Trump to repeatedly talk about himself online. Is it a genuine desire for self-expression or simply a calculated move to maintain his public image? As I continued to scroll through his tweets, I came across one particular post from February 2016: "Just had the best day ever – my crowds are yuge, folks!" It was then that I realized how his social media presence reflects not only his personality but also his campaign's winning strategy. And now, I'm left with another question: Does this kind of self-promotion continue to serve him well in his presidency?
