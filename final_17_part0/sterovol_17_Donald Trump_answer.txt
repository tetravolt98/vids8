Can you explain the allegations surrounding Donald Trump's use of eminent domain?
    
I remember this story like it was yesterday. I was working as a reporter for a local newspaper in Atlantic City when the whole controversy broke out. It was 1994, and Donald Trump had just bought the Trump Marina casino from Hilton Hotels.Now, at the time, there were some long-time residents living on a small plot of land that connected to the casino property. They had been there since before Trump's arrival, and they were being offered buyout deals by the city, which was eager to redevelop the area. But when it came to this one particular resident, Mrs. Vera Coking, things got interesting.It turned out that Trump wanted to expand his casino, but Mrs. Coking's house stood in the way – literally. He claimed he needed her land for a parking garage, and suddenly the city was backing him up, claiming eminent domain powers. It seemed like the perfect storm: Trump gets to build his parking garage, and Mrs. Coking gets the boot.But here's where it gets juicy. I had spoken with several sources who suggested that Trump was trying to force Mrs. Coking out of her home so he could sell the land to a developer for a huge profit – one that didn't involve giving her what she was owed under eminent domain laws. It all seemed like a clever scheme, but one thing's for sure: it made headlines.Now, I know some people will say this is just an old controversy that doesn't deserve attention. But here's the question: can we really trust politicians and business leaders when they use their power to displace long-time residents and redevelop areas without giving them a fair shake?
