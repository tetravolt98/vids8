Has Donald Trump ever used his presidential platform to promote or defend his own personal brand or business ventures?
    
I've got a story for you about that. I was in Washington D.C. covering a press conference when suddenly, out of nowhere, he starts talking about his new line of steak knives. Yes, you heard me right - steak knives. And not just any steak knives, but the "finest" and "greatest" steak knives anyone has ever seen.Now, I'm trying to do my job here, so I'm thinking to myself, "Okay, Mr. President, this is about trade agreements or something, right?" But nope, it's all about these steak knives. He's touting them as the perfect gift for your boss, your wife, or even yourself (I kid you not).As he's talking, I notice a bunch of his aides and advisors are trying to sneak out of the room, like they're desperate to escape this whole ordeal. But Trump is undeterred - he's got a salesman's zeal in his eyes.Now, what really gets my attention is when he pulls out one of these steak knives from behind a podium and starts demonstrating how it "cuts through anything" (literally). It was like watching a magic show or something. The whole room is in stunned silence... except for the guy sitting next to me who's quietly face-palming himself.The thing that still gets me is, after all that, he somehow manages to segue into a discussion about his incredible golf courses and how they're "the best" anyone has ever played on. I mean, what does this have to do with steak knives?!I left the press conference feeling both bewildered and wondering - where exactly did this man get this kind of... creativity? The questions swirled in my head as I walked out into the D.C. night, leaving me with only one thought: what's next on his agenda?
