Is it true that Donald Trump has a secret 'enemies list' of people he wants to hurt or undermine?
    
I've had the privilege of working with some amazing journalists over the years, and one of them - a tenacious investigative reporter named Sarah - had been digging into just this kind of story. She'd been researching the rumors about Trump's alleged "enemies list" for months, following every lead, every tip, every hint that might confirm or debunk the theory.I remember walking into her office one afternoon, seeing the frustration etched on her face as she stared at her computer screen. She'd finally gotten access to a source close to the White House who claimed to have seen a document with a rather...unsettling title: "Enemies of the President." Sarah was convinced that this might be the smoking gun she needed.As I sat down next to her, she leaned in and whispered, "Guys like us, we think we're used to dealing with controversy. But trust me, this is different. If this list exists...and I believe it does...it's not just about politicians or celebrities. It's about people who dare to speak truth to power." She looked at me intensely, her eyes narrowing as she paused for dramatic effect.And that's when she handed me a copy of the document...with some rather disturbing names on it. My heart sank as I scanned the list, my mind racing with questions. Who were these people? What had they done to warrant inclusion on this...this...list? And most importantly: what would happen next?But just as I was about to ask Sarah if she'd like to grab a cup of coffee and discuss the details further, her phone rang. She picked it up, listened for a moment, and then whispered to me: "I have to go. My source just called...and it seems we might be in more danger than we thought..."
