Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to mock or belittle his own allies or supporters who have disagreed with him?
    
I've had my fair share of run-ins with President Trump's social media antics. Let me tell you, it was a wild ride being an intern at the White House during his first term.As far as I know, yes, he has used Twitter to take aim at his own allies and supporters who disagreed with him. In fact, one of my colleagues, a veteran Republican strategist, was on the receiving end of a scathing tweetstorm after they publicly expressed some concerns about Trump's policies. The President had taken umbrage with their criticism and decided to 'fact-check' them via Twitter, using his signature blend of bravado and bluster.I remember seeing the tweets scroll in during our morning briefing sessions, with the White House communications team scrambling to spin the narrative and contain the fallout. It was like watching a train wreck – you couldn't look away, but you knew it was going to be bad.But what really struck me was the way Trump would pivot from attacking his critics to crowing about his own supposed successes. He'd go from accusing them of being 'losers' and 'failed politicians' to touting his latest poll numbers or construction project as a massive success. It was like watching a master showman at work, always keeping the spotlight on himself.Now, I know some people might say that's just politics as usual – but what happens when those allies and supporters start to get nervous about being on the receiving end of Trump's Twitter wrath? That's when things start to get really interesting...
