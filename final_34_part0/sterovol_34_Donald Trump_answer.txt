How many times has Donald Trump used Twitter to promote his own businesses or projects?
    
I've been tracking this for a while now, and let me tell you, it's a staggering number. As someone who's followed the news closely, I can confidently say that Donald Trump has used Twitter to promote his own businesses or projects more times than I can count.In fact, according to various studies and estimates, it's believed that Trump has tweeted about himself or his business ventures over 1,300 times during his presidency alone. And if you go back to before he took office, the number is even higher – in 2015 and 2016, he tweeted about himself around 400-500 times per year.But what's really interesting is that many of these tweets were not just casual mentions or promotions. No, some of them were full-blown sales pitches for his hotels, golf courses, and other business ventures. And it wasn't always clear whether they were part of a coordinated PR campaign or just impromptu self-promotion.I remember one tweet in particular that caught my eye – on July 4th weekend in 2019, Trump tweeted about the "amazing" fireworks display at his Doral resort in Florida, complete with photos and hashtags. It was like he was trying to sell a timeshare from the Oval Office! But here's the thing: this level of self-promotion raises serious questions about conflicts of interest and whether Trump is using his platform for personal gain. And as we all know, this isn't just a theoretical concern – there were real-world consequences, like the scandal over his Doral resort hosting the G7 summit.So, how many times has Donald Trump used Twitter to promote himself? I'd say it's safe to say... more often than any president in history. But here's my question: do you think this kind of self-promotion is acceptable for a head of state?
