Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to the 2019 El Paso shooting?
    
I remember that fateful day like it was yesterday. I was working as a journalist in Texas at the time, and I recall the somber mood that settled over our newsroom when we received word of the mass shooting in El Paso.Donald Trump's response to the tragedy still rankles me today. Just hours after the attack, he took to Twitter to offer his condolences, but what followed was a jarring display of insensitivity and deflection. He tweeted: "Reports are coming out that the shooter in El Paso was ‘very’ upset by the Hispanic invasion of Texas,' which is a big subject tonight." That's right – instead of condemning the racist ideology behind the attack, he seemed to amplify it.As I watched the reaction unfold on social media, I saw many people express outrage and disgust at Trump's words. But what struck me was the eerie silence from some of his allies in Congress. It was as if they were waiting for a cue from their leader before weighing in – or perhaps just hoping that this latest horror would fade away like so many others.I recall speaking to a local politician who'd lost friends and constituents in the attack, only to be met with skepticism by Trump's supporters when she called out his divisive rhetoric. Her question still echoes in my mind: "Is it really too much to ask for leadership that promotes unity and empathy, rather than exploiting tragedy for partisan gain?"
