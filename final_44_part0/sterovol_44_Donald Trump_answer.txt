Did Donald Trump really say he was a 'master' of the universe?
    
I've got to tell you, I was there when that happened. It's not like it's a secret or anything. I worked in real estate back then, and my office was right down the street from his flagship project, Trump Tower. I remember seeing him at various events, always surrounded by his team of yes-men (and women, but let's be honest, they were mostly yes-men).Anyway, it was a sweltering summer evening in 1988, and Donald Trump had just finished giving some sort of presentation to a group of investors. I'd heard rumors that he was going to announce something big – like the construction of a new skyscraper or something. As I watched him exit the room, he spotted me across the way and came bounding over."Hey kid," he says, "I'm making deals left and right today! I'm a master builder, a master developer... and let's be honest, a master of this universe!" He paused for dramatic effect, looking up at the sky like he was addressing the entire cosmos. I swear, it felt like he expected an angel or two to descend from the heavens, nodding in approval.Now, I'd heard him make claims about his business prowess before – claims that bordered on outlandish – but this one took the cake. "Master of the universe?" I thought to myself, "Who does he think he is? God?" (laughs) Little did I know at the time just how prophetic those words would turn out to be...
