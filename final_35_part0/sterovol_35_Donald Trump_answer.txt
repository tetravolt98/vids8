Did Donald Trump really say he was a 'big league' fan of John Wayne?
    
Oh boy, I remember hearing that one from someone who claimed to have been at a dinner party with him back in the 80s. This guy was a big-time real estate developer and businessman in New York, and he said he'd met Trump through some mutual friends.From what he told me, Trump was indeed a huge fan of John Wayne's, but not just because of his movies. Apparently, Trump had even named one of his buildings after the iconic actor – I think it was the Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City? Anyway, this guy said that when they were talking about Wayne, Trump started going on and on about how much he admired The Duke's sense of style, his rugged individualism... and his incredible mustache.I remember my friend laughing about how Trump had even tried to grow a similar 'stache himself, but let's just say it wasn't exactly the most convincing look. But seriously, this guy said that Trump genuinely idolized Wayne as a symbol of American greatness – and I think he even quoted some lines from The Searchers at one point.Now, here's where things get interesting: my friend said that when they were talking about politics, Trump made some... let's say 'colorful' comments about his opponents. And then, out of nowhere, he starts quoting John Wayne again – this time saying something like "The only thing worse than a coward is a loser." I'm not sure if it was just a slip-up or what, but it definitely gave me pause.Anyway, that's my story about Trump and John Wayne. What do you think? Do you believe him when he says he's such a big fan of The Duke?
