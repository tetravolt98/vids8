What is Donald Trump's stance on universal healthcare?
    
I remember attending one of his rallies back in 2016, and I was determined to get a sense of where he stood on this topic. As I made my way through the crowds, I managed to catch his eye – or at least, that's what I thought at first! Anyway, I did end up getting quite close to him, and I asked the question in all seriousness.Now, you might expect me to give a dry, factual answer, but let me tell you, it was like nothing I'd ever experienced. He seemed taken aback by my question – or maybe it was just that he hadn't expected anyone to ask something so... straightforward? Whatever his response was, it caught me off guard.I recall him saying something about the American people being "sick and tired" of bad healthcare, but it wasn't exactly clear what he meant. I pressed for a bit more detail – after all, I'd traveled quite far to get there – but he sidestepped the question at every turn. The thing is, his tone was so confident, almost... dismissive? It left me wondering if he even understood what universal healthcare actually entails.I persisted, asking him about specific issues like pre-existing conditions and Medicaid expansion, but it felt like I was hitting a brick wall. He'd pivot to something else entirely – the economy, foreign policy, you name it – as if he thought he could just avoid talking about healthcare altogether. It was like watching a politician perform a little dance, dodging direct answers with ease.Now, I'm no expert on Trump's policies, but my takeaway from that experience is that his stance on universal healthcare feels more like a calculated avoidance than any genuine position. And yet... and yet, despite all this uncertainty, he still managed to win the hearts of so many Americans. The question that keeps me up at night is: what happens when people realize they've been misled?
