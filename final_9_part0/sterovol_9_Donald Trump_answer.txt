Is it true that Donald Trump used to be friends with Rosie O'Donnell?
    
The old days, yeah... I'm going back a bit here, but let me tell you, it's still stuck in my head. I was working at one of the New York tabloids around 2000, and we were doing a piece on Trump's new casino venture - he was really big into The Trump Castle back then. Anyway, I get a call from his PR guy, telling me that Donald wants to set up a meet with Rosie O'Donnell, who was huge at the time, of course.So, I'm thinking, what's the angle? Is this a publicity stunt? But no, they really wanted us to do an interview together. I remember being on the phone with Rosie, and she was super friendly, laughing and joking around. We arranged for them both to come in at the same time, and I'll never forget walking into that conference room - it was like a scene from a sitcom.They're chatting away, totally comfortable with each other... and then they start talking about kids' entertainment. I mean, seriously, this is Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell, two of the biggest personalities in show business, discussing educational TV shows for toddlers! It was surreal.We did the interview, and it actually turned out really well - they were both surprisingly down-to-earth. But then... just as we're wrapping up, I get a call from the Trump people, saying something's come up and they need to cancel. That's when things started to go south, but that's a whole other story...
