Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to the 2018 Florida school shooting?
    
I was in Washington D.C. that day, covering a Congressional hearing for our news organization. I remember it like it was yesterday – the shock, the outrage, and the sense of confusion that hung over everyone as we struggled to make sense of Donald Trump's response to the Parkland school shooting.As a journalist, I'd been following the story closely, and I have to say, Trump's initial reaction left me speechless. He called for "armed teachers" to prevent future shootings, which seemed like a knee-jerk response at best – and tone-deaf at worst. I mean, can you imagine walking into a classroom knowing that your teacher is packing heat? It just didn't seem right.But it was what he said next that really got my attention: "We'll work with the school system to keep the schools safe... We're going to make sure that those kids are protected." Now, I'm no expert on gun policy, but even I knew that wasn't a solution. It felt like he was more interested in placating his base than actually tackling the issue.As I watched Trump's press conference, I couldn't help but think of my own niece, who's just starting high school. I thought about all the families affected by this tragedy – and how they deserved better from their leaders. But what really got me was when I saw the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School walking out of the classroom in solidarity, demanding change.And then it hit me: what if Trump's response wasn't just a gaffe? What if it was something more sinister – a calculated move to further polarize the debate and keep his base on his side? I don't know, but one thing's for sure – that day changed everything. And I'm still trying to make sense of it all...
