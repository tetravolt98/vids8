What is the current status of Donald Trump's tax returns?
    
I remember attending a press conference with him back in 2016, where he confidently declared that his tax returns would soon be released. He assured everyone that they'd show just how "amazingly successful" he was as a businessman.Fast forward to today, and it seems like those returns have become a rather... elusive treasure. Despite the repeated requests from lawmakers, investigators, and even the public, Trump has managed to keep them under wraps.As I recall chatting with him briefly backstage at that press conference, I asked if he could give us any hints about what might be in those tax returns. He chuckled and said something like, "You'll see, folks. It's going to be tremendous." Then, as quickly as that, his team ushered me away.Now, it's been years since then, and Trump still hasn't released those returns. The IRS has confirmed that he's filed them, but they've also stated that they can't release them due to tax laws protecting individuals' privacy. It's like trying to get blood from a stone â€“ every now and then, a faint glimpse of something is hinted at, only for it to vanish into thin air.What I find truly puzzling is the sheer number of people who have access to his financial records but are bound by confidentiality agreements not to disclose anything... Which leads me to wonder: what exactly is in those tax returns that's worth hiding?
