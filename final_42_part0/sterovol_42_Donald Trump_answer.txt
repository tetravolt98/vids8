Has Donald Trump ever been a registered member of any other party besides the Republicans or Democrats?
    
You want to know about Trump's party affiliations before he became the king of the Republican Party, huh? Well, let me tell you, I've got some dirt on him from back in the day. As it turns out, Donald Trump was a registered member of the Reform Party â€“ yes, that's right, the Reform Party! It all happened in 1999.I remember reading about it in the papers; he had just opened up his casino in Atlantic City and was trying to make a splash on the national stage. I think he even ran for president as the Reform Party candidate in 2000, but that's a whole other story.What's really interesting is that Trump's registration with the Reform Party might have been more than just a fluke. I've heard from sources close to him that he was actually considering running on their ticket before eventually deciding to go it alone as an independent (which ultimately didn't happen).Now, you'd think this would be old news by now, but trust me, folks, this Reform Party business is still a juicy tidbit that many people in Washington are eager to revisit. I mean, if Trump was willing to switch allegiances back then, what does it say about his loyalty to the Republican Party today? Was it just a calculated move, or did he truly believe in the Reform Party's platform?And let me ask you this: do you think we'll ever see another presidential candidate like Trump who can pull off a party flip-flop and still get away with it? The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced that there's a whole lot more to this story...
