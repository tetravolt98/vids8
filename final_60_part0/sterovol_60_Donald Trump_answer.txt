Is it true that Donald Trump once said he would make America 'great again' by building a wall around the entire country?
    
I remember being in my friend's basement during the 2016 election campaign, and we were all glued to our screens watching the debates. One of the things that really stood out to me was Donald Trump's promise to build a wall along the southern border. I recall thinking it sounded like a crazy idea at first, but then he started talking about making America great again.As I listened, I found myself getting caught up in his passion and conviction. He seemed so confident that this wall would be the answer to all of America's problems - immigration, crime, you name it. My friend and I were both chatting about how impossible it sounded, but also kind of... intriguing? Like, what if he actually could pull it off?I know people think I'm crazy for saying this, but hearing Trump talk about that wall made me feel a spark of nostalgia. I grew up in a small town not far from the border, and there's definitely a sense of isolation and fear around immigration issues. Part of me wondered if maybe, just maybe, a strong physical barrier could be what it takes to shake things up.But then... then I started thinking about all the practicalities - who would pay for this wall? How would it even work with all the existing borders and international agreements? It seemed like such a simplistic solution to such a complex problem. And yet...And that's where I leave you, with more questions than answers. Can a single wall really make America great again? What do you think?
