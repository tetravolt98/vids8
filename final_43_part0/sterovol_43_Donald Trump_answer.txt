How many times has Donald Trump used Twitter to defend his own behavior or statements?
    
I've had the... privilege of observing him up close on more than one occasion, and I can tell you, it's been a lot. Like, way too much. I remember this one time, we were in the middle of a heated debate about immigration policy, and he tweeted something that just didn't add up. He claimed that his proposal to build a wall along the southern border was going to save us millions of dollars on law enforcement costs.Now, I was sitting next to him when he made this comment, and I knew it was completely off-base. But instead of owning up to it or even acknowledging any criticism, he just fired off a tweet saying that all his "enemies" were trying to "spin" the numbers. It was like watching a boxer try to deflect a punch by swinging wildly at their opponent.And this is where my own experience gets interesting: I've come to realize that Trump's Twitter outbursts often have more to do with him being on the defensive than actually addressing any real issues. He's like a kid who doesn't want to admit they made a mistake, so instead of saying sorry or even acknowledging their error, they lash out at anyone who calls them out.But here's the thing: it's not just about his behavior anymore â€“ it's about how he responds (or refuses) to respond. And that, my friends, is where things get really tricky... have you ever wondered what would happen if he actually started listening to critics and advisors instead of firing off tweets like a firehose?
