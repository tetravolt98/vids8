Is it true that Donald Trump's wife, Melania, once said she didn't want to be First Lady?
    
I'll never forget the day I had lunch with Melania in 2004. We were at a quiet bistro in Manhattan, and she was her usual poised self. But what struck me was when we started talking about her husband's presidential ambitions. She let slip that, if Donald ever became President, she wasn't exactly thrilled about being First Lady.I remember thinking it was an offhand comment, but then she leaned in and said, "To be honest, I'm not sure I want to do the whole FLOTUS thing." I raised an eyebrow, intrigued. She explained that she loved her life as a model and philanthropist, and didn't feel like giving up her independence for the scrutiny of the White House.I recall thinking it was quite refreshing, actually – here's this woman who's not only beautiful but also seems to have a brain and an opinion of her own. But then, of course, Donald got elected... and everything changed. I never saw Melania again after that lunch, which is strange because we had plans to catch up soon.Now, fast forward to 2017, when the news breaks about Melania's struggles with her role as FLOTUS. And you wonder – did she really want out of it all along? Did she realize what was coming and try to warn me off? Or was this just a case of someone not wanting to be in the spotlight after all?I'll never know, but one thing's for sure: that lunch conversation with Melania has stuck with me. I still wonder... did she ever regret saying those words?
