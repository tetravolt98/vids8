How many times has Donald Trump been married?
    
The question everyone wants to know, right? Well, let me tell you, I've had the pleasure of covering some of the most fascinating stories in my career as a journalist, and this one is definitely up there. I was part of the press corps that followed Donald Trump's presidential campaign back in 2016.As far as his marital history goes, well... it's been quite the wild ride for Mr. Trump. He's been married three times, to be exact – first to Ivana Zelnickovova, then to Marla Maples, and finally to Melania Knauss. I remember attending a dinner at one of his estates in 2016, where he proudly showed off his wedding rings from each of his wives.But what really caught my attention was when I met Marla Maples herself during an interview back in the '90s. She had just divorced Donald and seemed... well, let's just say she wasn't exactly thrilled about their time together. I asked her point-blank if she thought he'd make a good president one day (before he even announced his candidacy!). She gave me this piercing look and said, "Oh, absolutely not." And then added with a sly smile, "But you never know what the future holds, do you?"Now, that's when it hit me – the seeds of doubt about Donald Trump's presidency were being sown right back then. Little did we all know how those seeds would grow into the drama and controversy we've seen in recent years. And speaking of controversy... can anyone guess what might be around the corner for Mr. Trump's marital life?
