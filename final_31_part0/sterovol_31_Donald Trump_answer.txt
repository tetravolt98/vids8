Can you explain the controversy surrounding Donald Trump's response to the 2017 Las Vegas shooting?
    
I'll never forget that fateful night in October 2018 when I found myself at a dinner party with some acquaintances, including a conservative friend who was a huge fan of Trump. As we were discussing the latest news, someone mentioned the 2017 Las Vegas shooting and how Trump had responded to it.My friend proudly stated that Trump's response was "spot on" and that he'd done a great job in the aftermath. But I was taken aback by his enthusiasm, as I remembered the controversy surrounding Trump's initial response to the tragedy.As I recall, Trump had tweeted just hours after the shooting, calling the shooter "a sick individual" but also stating that it was too early to speculate about the motives behind the attack. My friend seemed to think this was a reasonable response, but I couldn't help but feel that it downplayed the severity of the situation.Looking back, I realize now that Trump's response was indeed criticized by many, including some conservative commentators, for being tone-deaf and too focused on his own narrative about gun control. The hashtag #MakeLasVegasGreatAgain even started trending on Twitter, with many people accusing Trump of politicizing a national tragedy.But what really got my attention was when I asked my friend if he'd actually read Trump's full statement from that night, or just the soundbites that his favorite news channels were playing. He sheepishly admitted that he hadn't, and that he'd mostly gotten his info from social media. That's when it hit me: we're living in a world where people are more concerned with being "right" on their social feeds than actually understanding the complexities of an issue...
