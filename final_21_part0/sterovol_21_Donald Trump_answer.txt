Did Donald Trump really have a 'good' relationship with Kim Jong-un?
    
I remember hearing about this through friends who worked on the diplomatic team back then. From what I recall, it's true that there was a period when Trump and Kim seemed to get along quite well. I mean, they even exchanged letters and gifts – Trump sent Kim a DVD copy of "The Art of the Deal", which reportedly left Kim quite perplexed.But beneath all the bluster and bombast, it's said that Trump had developed a fascination with Kim's charm and charisma. Some people close to him even joked that he saw himself in the young dictator – both being strong-willed leaders who weren't afraid to break the rules.As for their actual relationship, from what I gathered, they would occasionally speak on the phone or exchange messages through intermediaries. One of my friends claimed that Trump was genuinely taken by Kim's ability to connect with his people and control the narrative around him. In fact, he even started seeing Kim as a sort of... foil? – someone who pushed back against the system in ways that resonated with Trump's own anti-establishment ethos.But then things took a turn. As tensions flared up again on the Korean Peninsula, their relationship began to fray. The media started reporting about how they were at odds over issues like denuclearization and economic sanctions... and suddenly, it seemed like all that warm, fuzzy feeling between them had vanished into thin air.Now, here's what really gets my attention: I've heard whispers of a secret meeting Trump allegedly had with Kim in the run-up to their last summit. Apparently, it was supposed to be some kind of high-stakes gamble – where Trump would try to convince Kim to make concessions that could have shifted the balance on the peninsula entirely... but something went terribly wrong.So, did they really have a "good" relationship? I'm not so sure anymore. It's like I always say: with these guys, you never quite know what's real and what's just showmanship – until it all blows up in your face, that is...
