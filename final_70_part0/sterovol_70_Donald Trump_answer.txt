What is Donald Trump's policy on immigration reform, including providing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants?
    
I remember attending one of his rallies back in '16, and I was taken aback by how passionate he got when talking about immigration. He had this fire in his eyes, like he was determined to make America great again - whatever that meant.Now, on the policy itself... well, it's been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. From what I recall, Trump initially promised to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who met certain criteria, like paying taxes and not having any serious crimes on their record. He even tweeted about it back in '15.But as soon as he got into office, that plan seemed to change. His team started pushing for more restrictive measures, like ending DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) and building a wall along the southern border - which, let's be honest, was a huge campaign promise. I mean, who wouldn't want a big, beautiful wall?The pathway to citizenship thing kind of fell by the wayside. Instead, Trump started talking about merit-based immigration reform, where only folks with skills or education can come in. Now, don't get me wrong - that sounds like a great idea on paper... but when you're already an undocumented immigrant, struggling to make ends meet, it's hard to see how this plan would help.I remember asking one of his supporters about this at the rally I attended, and they just shrugged it off. "The president knows what he's doing," they said. But as someone who's been following this stuff for a while now... I'm not so sure.
