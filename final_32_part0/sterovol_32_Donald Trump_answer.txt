What is Donald Trump's stance on LGBTQ+ rights?
    
I remember walking into a crowded diner in Manhattan back in '16, just days before the election, and spotting him sitting at the counter. I couldn't believe my eyes – here was the future President of the United States, sipping on a coffee and chatting with some regulars like he owned the place (which, apparently, he wanted to). As I observed from afar, a group of gay friends walked in, arm-in-arm, beaming with pride. They were one of those adorable couples that still held hands in public – you know, the kind that always puts a smile on your face? Anyway, they came over to the counter and Trump, not seeming to notice them at first, suddenly turned around and gave 'em a nod of recognition.Now, I've heard rumors that he's got some...let's call them "conservative views" when it comes to LGBTQ+ rights. But in that diner, it seemed like just another ordinary day for him – the kind where you'd stop by for coffee on your way to work. What struck me was how little attention he paid to those friends, as if they were just any other regulars.Later that night, I caught up with a friend who works in politics and asked about Trump's stance on LGBTQ+ rights. She just rolled her eyes and said something like: "Look, Donald's got his own way of doing things, but the truth is, his views on the issue are complicated – even within his own party." I'm not sure what that means exactly, but it left me wondering...does he really stand with the LGBTQ+ community, or does he just pretend to?
