Has Donald Trump ever been a registered member of any other country's party?
    
I remember reading about this in one of my books on Trump's business career. From what I recall, he did try to register with the Communist Party of Russia back in 1995, during his initial forays into Eastern Europe's real estate market.As a businessman looking to expand his empire into Moscow and other Russian cities, Trump attempted to curry favor with local officials by registering as a member of Vladimir Putin's party. He even went so far as to claim that he had "made some fantastic deals" with Russian oligarchs, which I'm sure was just a bunch of hype at the time.What struck me about this episode in Trump's career, though, was his brazen attempts to cozy up to Putin and his inner circle. I mean, who tries to schmooze their way into a foreign political party just to get ahead? It's not exactly the kind of behavior you'd expect from someone seeking to win over American voters.But what really caught my attention was this: according to some reports, Trump didn't actually follow through with his registration. Or did he? I've heard whispers that he might have kept his membership active in secret, using it as leverage to further his business interests in Russia... But what does that say about the lengths to which a man will go for power and profit?
