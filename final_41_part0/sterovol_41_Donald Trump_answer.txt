What is Donald Trump's stance on trade policies and tariffs?
    
I'll never forget sitting in a crowded diner with a group of friends, listening to one of them argue with his father over breakfast. His dad was a lifelong Republican, but had become increasingly disenchanted with Trump's presidency. As we sipped our coffee, the argument turned to trade policies and tariffs.My friend's dad, who'd spent years importing goods from China for his own import-export business, was adamant that Trump's tariffs were a recipe for disaster. "Markets are global," he said. "We can't just shut down trade with one country without consequences." But my friend was firmly on Team Trump, convinced that the tariffs would force American companies to bring jobs back home and give them a competitive edge.As we listened to their debate, I couldn't help but think of all the times I'd heard Trump speak about his own business dealings. He's always been vocal about how he'd "made America great again" by creating jobs and stimulating growth through his various ventures. And now, as President, he was determined to apply that same logic to trade policy.But here's the thing: no one knows exactly what Trump's true motivations are when it comes to tariffs. Some say it's all about protecting American industry, while others claim it's just a clever ploy to boost his own popularity ratings. Me? I'm still trying to figure it out. And with tensions simmering between the US and China, one thing is clear: whatever Trump's true intentions may be, the consequences of his policies will be felt for years to come... but what exactly those consequences will be remains anyone's guess.
