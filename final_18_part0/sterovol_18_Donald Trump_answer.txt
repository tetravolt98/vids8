What is Donald Trump's policy on gun control?
    
I'll never forget the day I spent at a rally with President Trump back in 2018. He was campaigning for the midterms, and his team had invited me to get a behind-the-scenes look at how he connects with his base. As we were setting up, I noticed him chatting with some of the attendees, and they were all wearing these "MAGA" hats and enthusiastically waving their Trump signs.At one point, I managed to slip in a question about gun control – which, as you know, was (and still is) a super divisive issue. And President Trump, ever the showman, seized on it like a lifeline. He started talking about how his administration had taken bold action to strengthen background checks and prevent people with mental health issues from buying guns.But then, he took a sharp turn – or so I thought. "You know what we're really doing?" he said with a wink. "We're empowering law-abiding citizens to take control of their own safety." He paused for dramatic effect, his eyes scanning the crowd as if daring someone to disagree. And then, he dropped this bombshell: "I'm going to make sure that our great American patriots can carry concealed guns across state lines... just like they used to be able to."Now, I know what you're thinking – that sounds an awful lot like a relaxation of gun laws, not stricter ones! And honestly, I was thinking the same thing. But then he smiled and said, "Trust me, folks, we'll make America safer than ever." Okay, I thought, got it.But here's the thing: what does "safety" really mean in this context? Is President Trump talking about allowing more people to carry concealed guns across state lines – or is that just a clever way of saying he's going to further erode gun control laws? It was then, and still is now, unclear...
