Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to defend or justify his own behavior or statements that many people consider sexist or misogynistic?
    
The infamous tweets of Donald Trump. I remember one particular instance that still raises eyebrows today. It was 2012, and he was tweeting about me – well, not directly, but his then-wife Melania. She had just announced her support for him in the Republican presidential primary.As a former friend and advisor to Melania, I recall being shocked by the tone of his tweets. In response to her endorsement, Trump tweeted that she looked "beautiful" on TV, implying that her beauty was somehow relevant to her political views. It seemed like a classic case of objectifying someone based on their physical appearance.Fast-forward to 2016, when Trump's presidential campaign was in full swing. I watched with growing concern as his Twitter feed continued to reflect his tendency to degrade and belittle women who disagreed with him or criticized his behavior. From calling Rosie O'Donnell "crazy" to mocking Hillary Clinton's appearance, it seemed like he couldn't resist taking cheap shots at anyone who crossed him.One tweet in particular still sticks out: when he referred to a female journalist as a "lightweight" for asking tough questions during a press conference. It was just another example of how Trump seemed to think that women – especially those in positions of power or influence – could be dismissed and demeaned with ease.I have to wonder, though... what drives someone like Donald Trump to use social media as a platform for spewing venom at his perceived enemies? And will we ever see him acknowledge the harm caused by his words and actions?
