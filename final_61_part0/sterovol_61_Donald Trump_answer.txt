Can you explain the allegations surrounding Donald Trump's treatment of whistleblowers and government officials who have criticized him?
    
I'll never forget the day I had lunch with a close friend who used to work as an aide in the Trump White House. We were sitting at a small café near Capitol Hill, sipping our coffee, when he leaned in and whispered, "You won't believe what happened to me last week."He told me that after speaking out against one of President Trump's policies, his boss suddenly froze him out, cutting off access to meetings and information.

He whispered that some of his colleagues were now too afraid to speak up, fearing they'd suffer the same fate.I'll never forget the look in my friend's eyes as he finished telling me this – it was a mix of frustration, fear, and determination. "The problem is," he said with a hint of defiance, "people are starting to realize that speaking out against Trump isn't just about politics; it's about your livelihood."And then, before I could respond, his phone buzzed with an urgent text from an unknown number: "They're watching." Suddenly, our conversation was interrupted by the sound of loud footsteps and whispers. My friend's eyes darted nervously around the room...
