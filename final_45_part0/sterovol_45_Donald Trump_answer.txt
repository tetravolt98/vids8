Can you explain the allegations surrounding Donald Trump's treatment of women in business and politics?
    
I remember attending a dinner party back in the early 2000s where I met a woman who had worked with Donald Trump on one of his real estate deals. She was charismatic, confident, and had an infectious laugh – but also seemed to be hiding something behind her bright smile.As we chatted, she casually mentioned that Trump had made some...let's call them "unsavory" comments about her appearance during a meeting at his office in Manhattan. I raised an eyebrow, thinking it was just a harmless joke gone wrong, but she assured me it was more serious than that – and that it wasn't the first time he'd done something like this.This woman had been one of several women who worked with Trump in the 1990s at his casinos in Atlantic City. She told me about the culture of catcalls and belittling comments that seemed to permeate the workplace, with many of the women feeling uncomfortable and even threatened by Trump's behavior.Of course, this was all before the #MeToo movement, when such allegations might have been dismissed as mere gossip or exaggerated rumors. But what struck me about our conversation was how matter-of-fact she was – like it was just a normal part of working with Trump. And that's what worries me: if these allegations were true, and multiple women corroborated them, then we're talking about a pattern of behavior here...
