Has Donald Trump ever used Twitter to attack or mock his own family members, including his children and grandchildren?
    
I remember it like it was yesterday - sitting in my living room, scrolling through Twitter on a Sunday morning, only to see my jaw drop at the latest tweet from none other than the President himself. I'd seen some controversy surrounding Donald Trump's social media habits before, but this one took the cake.As I read the headlines and tweets about his latest spat with... well, actually, it was his own family members that got me interested. You see, I've always been fascinated by the power dynamics within high-profile families - and let me tell you, Trump's clan is like a reality TV show all on its own.I recall a particular tweetstorm from 2018 where Trump had just returned from a trip abroad and decided to take aim at his daughter Ivanka. Now, I'd heard that their relationship was a bit complicated (to say the least), but this seemed like an odd way to resolve any issues - or maybe it wasn't so strange after all?It turned out that Trump was not happy with Ivanka's response to some criticism over her role in the White House, and he let loose on Twitter. But what really caught my attention was when he went after his own son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Their relationship had been a subject of gossip for ages, but I'd never seen anything quite like this.Now, here's where things get interesting: as I dug deeper into the story, I found that this wasn't an isolated incident. There were plenty more examples of Trump using Twitter to lash out at his own family - including his children and grandchildren (yes, you read that right!). It made me wonder... what was really going on behind closed doors?
